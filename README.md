# RedLite

RedLite is a Reddit clone that allows users to view a feed of different posts from various subreddits. The user can apply filters to the feed, and select and search for specific subreddits from a list.

## Description

This app was built with React and uses the Reddit API that allows users to:

- Browse and view posts from various subreddits.

- Search and view specific subreddits.

- Upvote/downvote posts and comments (for demonstration purposes only, does not affect actual scores.)

- View comments left on posts.

- Apply filters to both the main feed and specific subreddits.

## Why I built this

- This project was built as a portfolio project that is part of the Front End Engineer career path on Codecademy and one of the projects I needed to complete to earn the Front End Engineer certification at the end of the course.
